## Whats this??
This repository contains an alternate version of meta, originally released by jac459 (https://github.com/jac459/meta).
## Why an alternate version? 
Good question! The original version of jac is excellent! So why an alternate one?
The reason is simple: just like me, jac develops meta mostly for his own needs, but shares the code to others so they can profit from it.
If he sees fit, he adds pieces to meta for others. I've created many additions to meta and offered them to be included into the original release of meta.
However, that process became too slow or requests weren't honored at all (which is the right from an author, of-course).
As these changes are essential for the drivers that I produce (especially for KODI), I started maintaining a separate verison of meta which included new releases from JAC and my own changes.
That became too much time-consuming, so I decided to take the current version of JAC's meta, duplicate that into my own github repository and stopped looking at the original meta as that basis fits all my needs.

In short: this meta-Plus is a copy of jAC's meta with a lot of extra functions that I see as necessary, but it is a one-time copy of the original version... the basis of meta-plus will not be kept in sync with the original meta.

## Why should I use an outdated version of meta?
Thats completely up to you! I'm not forcing you to do so;-). 
If you want to use drivers that I develop (KODI, ADB, Telnet, Broadlink, Tasmota) then you need Meta-Plus. if you're happy with the original meta, please use that one.
If you decide to use Meta-Plus, then you can get into issues in the future with drivers that are developed for the original meta. Not necessaryly, but it could.

## Why don;t you just keep Meta-Plus in sync with Meta?
Though thats a good idea, there are some (good) reasons for not doing that:
- First it will take an awfull amount of time.
- Second, some changes are simply not compatible. Discovery for example is based on a totally different solution, yet is at the heart of meta.
- Third, the current version of meta is basically quite stable and hasn't been extended for months (though still containing bugs, a number that I fixed in Meta-Plus), so whats the need for it...
- Fourth: I did that for a long period, but there was no interest in the changes I offered to be integrated; so I've turned away from meta-development and started Meta-Plus.

## Can I use Meta-Plus and what support do you offer?
As said above, I've created Meta-Plus basically for myself so drivers like Kodi, ADB, Telnet and Tasmota can be used fully, not crippled.
Since I put all my work onto github, you are free to use it. It's free, I'm not going to ask you for donations (in fact, I've decline them in the past), the only thing I'm asking you is to tell me you are using it (ozothe clown et life dit com). 
If you experience any issues, you are welcome to report them through github-issues. I'm happy to look at them and try to fix them if I see fit, just do not expect gurantees.
