## Raspberry pi
I'm working on an installation script (99.9% ready) that will be placed here.

## Docker
I've got a working image on hub.docker: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tonot1/meta
In fact, that image is just the original meta (november 2021 version) in which you can easily replace the original with meta-PLus modules.
I'll add a complete description on how to do this later.
